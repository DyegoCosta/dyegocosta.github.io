# About

A clean concise theme for your GitHub projects from [Fublo](http://fublo.net).

# Configuration

You will need to configure the following elements.

 * The GitHub ribbons - Located near the bottom of the HTML. You can change the colour and link
 * The download button link
 * The pages title tag
 * All content, examples, descriptions etc. Leaving lorum ipsum laying about does not look good. This includes the first part of the footer, please leave the very last line.
