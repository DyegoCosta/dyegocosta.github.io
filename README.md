# Configuration

You will want to change the link in the fork ribbon, this is located at the bottom of the page.

Just change this.

    <a href='https://github.com/USER/REPOSITORY' class='github-ribbon'>...

To point to your repository.

On the same line you can also change the path to the image so you can have it in green for example. Check out `assets/images/github-ribbons` for all possible colours.
